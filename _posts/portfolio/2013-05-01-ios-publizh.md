When I was working at Apptividia, I have responsibility to rewrite and refactor old unfinish ios code from the ground up of the main product of the company called **Publizh**. Publizh is a platform for Interactive e-book available in Android and iOS. The customer can create the interactive spot in any page of PDF such as video, sound, 3D image viewer and much more in the web-base application and apply in all platform.

These are the apps that use this platform and published on the Apple Store while I was working there. I support it until end of iOS 6.
