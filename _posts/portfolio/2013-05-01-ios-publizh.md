When I was working at Apptividia, I had to rewrite and refactor old unfinish ios code from the ground up of the main product of the company called **Publizh**. Publizh is a platform for Interactive e-book available in Android and iOS. The customer can create the interactive spot in any page of PDF such as video, sound, 3D image viewer and much more using the web-base application and read it in all platform.

The app also has a shelf for download, update version and delete books.

These were many apps that used this platform and published on the Apple Store while I was working there.
