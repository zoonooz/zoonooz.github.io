SG TravelKaki is the app that provides you with important information on what travellers can (and cannot) bring back into Singapore from their overseas trips.

I worked with team at Dezainwerkz to make this app. Because there is a lot of contents and pages to be displayed, We decided to use **XML** as the common data format and create parser in both platform to generate native UI and display.
