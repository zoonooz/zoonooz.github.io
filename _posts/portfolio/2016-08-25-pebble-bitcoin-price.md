After I got interested in Bitcoin and invested some of my money into it. I became addicted to checking the bitcoin price all the time.

As I own a pebble watch, I decided to learn and create this simple bitcoin price checking watchface so I can just glance at my wrist and see the current price.

Currently, it can get the latest price from Bitflyer and Coinbase. You can check source code on [github](https://github.com/zoonooz/BitcoinWatch) and download at [Pebble store](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/57cc2c33be5ad0d9500002cd).
