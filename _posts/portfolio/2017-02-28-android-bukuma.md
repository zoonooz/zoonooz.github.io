My second application in Japan is [„Éñ„ÇØ„Éû](https://xn--pck0dza.com/)(bukuma) for Android.

**„Éñ„ÇØ„Éû** is marketplace application that allows users to buy and sell books. Users can easily find the existing books by scanning ISBN or easily create a new one in the app.  They can keep track of ongoing transactions, the status of delivery, built-in chat to chat with seller or buyer and review system to help decide.

The app was built by **Kotlin** as the main language with popular libraries like Dagger2, RxJava, and Retrofit.
