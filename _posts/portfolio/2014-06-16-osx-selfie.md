My company is doing marketing campaign for [Directbox](http://directcloud.net/) and building a booth at [CommunicAsia](http://www.communicasia.com/) in Singapore 17-20 June. My boss want to have the mirror that can automatically snap photo when the user smiling and then print out the photo using [DirectPrint](http://directcloud.net/direct-cloud/) feature at this booth.

The app made on OSX platform and use ```CIDetector``` class in standard OSX library to make this happen. It connected with external webcam for high resolution photo and Adruino for showing led indicator before it snap.
