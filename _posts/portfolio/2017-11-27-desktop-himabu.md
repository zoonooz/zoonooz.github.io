Because I was doing social network application, to give the users full access to the service is to make the application available in all platforms as many as possible. As [Himabu](https://www.himabu.com) is already available in iOS and Android, the next platform has to be desktop if we are talking about communication application. I decided to share the idea in the meeting and it turns out that we did not have enough resource and people to do it. I used my free time in the weekends to create this prototype and it is working really well.

The app was built using **Electron** framework with **ReactJS** and **RxJS**. Thanks to Electron, the app can be used in Windows and Linux as well.
