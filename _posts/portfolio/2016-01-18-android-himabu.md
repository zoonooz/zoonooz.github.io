My first application here, after moved to Japan is [Himabu](http://www.himabu.com) for Android. I am working alone as Android developer at [Nanameue](http://nanameue.jp/) to create this application which is already exists in the Appstore.

**Himabu** is social application that focus on students. To use their free times to communicate and make new friends with other students around Japan. Students can create group, chat or post something to public timeline.

I use **RxJava** and **Kotlin** to build this application.
