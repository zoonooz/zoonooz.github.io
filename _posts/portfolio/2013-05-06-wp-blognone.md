[Blognone](https://www.blognone.com/) is a technology news website in Thailand that I like to read. After I got Nokia Lumia 520, I decided to learn this new platform, *Windows Phone*. This app is my first Windows Phone app.

The app can view images, youtube video, code sniplets, nested comments and the user can share the news to social networks. There are feartures that available only in paid version such as app color, font size and live tile.
