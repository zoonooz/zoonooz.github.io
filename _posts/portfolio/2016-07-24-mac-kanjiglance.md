When I was living in Japan, I wanted to learn Japanese and remember the hardest part of the language, **Kanji!**.

I created a Mac app which basically just show kanji on the menu bar randomly with the meaning. If I open it I can see all the readings and meanings. The displayed kanji will be changed periodically so whenever I glance at it, I can learn a new one or remind me of the one I have learned.
